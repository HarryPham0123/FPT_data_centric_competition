# FPT data centric competition
## Introduction
Deep Learning models have become exceedingly developed and popular in recent years. On the other hand, data processing techniques have not been equally developed compared to models

In this competition, participants are provided with a dataset. The goal is to use processing techniques on that dataset to ensure that model achieves the best performance after training.

Following Reinforcement Learning Competition 2021 success, DataComp is a brand new competition with a new approach for researchers. Besides that, DataComp was created to contribute to the prevention of Covid-19 pandemic, using face mask recognition model.
